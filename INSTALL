Just run the usual:

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


If you want to add compilerflags do it like this:

    make CFLAGS="-O2 -fstack-protector"


If you don't like the installation path you can change them, for
example, like this:

    make install prefix=/usr mandir=/usr/share/man


Take a closer look at the Makefile.in to see what's possible.
